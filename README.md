# Partitioning a graph into low-diameter clusters

This is the GitHub repository for the paper "Partitioning a graph into low-diameter clusters" by Jack Zhang, Lucas Silveira, Hamidreza Validi, Logan Smith, Austin Buchanan, and Illya V. Hicks.

The minimum s-club partitioning problems seeks finding a partition of the vertex set such that the diameter of each part in its corresponding subgraph is at most s. 

The following figures show a minimum 2-club and 3-club partition for the social network of the [Zachary's karate club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club).
