# Partitioning a graph into low-diameter clusters

This is the GitHub repository for the paper "Partitioning a graph into low-diameter clusters" by Jack Zhang, Lucas Silveira, Hamidreza Validi, Logan Smith, Austin Buchanan, and Illya V. Hicks.

Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, $T \subseteq V$ is called an $s$-club if $\diam(G[T]) \le s$, where $G[T]$ and $\diam(G[T])$ represent the subgraph induced by the vertex set $T$ and the diameter of $G[T]$, respectively.
